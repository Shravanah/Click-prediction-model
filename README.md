# ad_click
This repository contains a project on logistic regression, in which we can predict whether or not a particular user clicked on an advertisement based off  the features of that user.
The dataset contains 'Daily time spent on site': consumer time on site in minutes, 'Age':Customer age in years, 'Area Income': Avg income of graphical area of the customer, and so on.
I imported many libraries for exploratory data analysis and for training and testing a logistic regression model. From this project we can learn classification and probability outcomes of the people's intrest in a specific add.
